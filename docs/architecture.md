# TailPost Architecture

This document provides a detailed overview of the TailPost architecture, its components, and how they interact.

## Overview

TailPost is designed with a modular, layered architecture that separates concerns and allows for flexibility and extensibility. The system is composed of several main components that work together to collect, process, and deliver logs securely.

## Core Components

### 1. Log Readers

The Log Readers component is responsible for collecting logs from various sources:

- **File Reader**: Reads logs from files with support for rotation and follow mode
- **Windows Event Reader**: Collects logs from Windows Event Log
- **macOS ASL Reader**: Gathers logs from macOS Apple System Log
- **Kubernetes Readers**: Collects logs from containers and pods in Kubernetes environments

Implementation details:
- Uses a factory pattern to create appropriate readers based on configuration
- Employs efficient IO operations with buffering
- Handles file rotation and truncation transparently
- Platform-specific code is isolated for maintainability

### 2. Log Pipeline

The Log Pipeline processes logs before they are sent:

- Parsing and structuring raw logs
- Filtering logs based on configuration
- Batching logs for efficient transmission
- Enriching logs with metadata

Implementation details:
- Uses Go channels for efficient data flow
- Processes logs concurrently for performance
- Handles backpressure gracefully
- Provides hooks for custom processing

### 3. Log Senders

The Log Senders component is responsible for delivering logs to their destination:

- **HTTP Sender**: Sends logs to HTTP/HTTPS endpoints
- Handles batching, retries, and exponential backoff
- Manages connection pooling and timeouts

Implementation details:
- Retries failed transmissions with backoff
- Optimizes batching for network efficiency
- Supports various authentication methods
- Handles TLS connections securely

### 4. Security Layer

The Security layer provides:

- **TLS**: Certificate validation and secure connections
- **Authentication**: OAuth, API keys, and other methods
- **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption of log content
- **Credential Management**: Secure storage and handling of secrets

Implementation details:
- Uses standard Go crypto libraries
- Supports multiple authentication schemes
- Implements secure defaults

### 5. Telemetry & Monitoring

This component provides:

- **OpenTelemetry integration**: Distributed tracing
- **Prometheus metrics**: Performance and operational metrics
- **Health checks**: Status monitoring
- **Logging**: Internal logging for troubleshooting

Implementation details:
- Exports metrics in standard formats
- Self-monitoring capabilities
- Low overhead performance impact

### 6. Configuration Management

- **YAML-based configuration**: Flexible configuration options
- **Environmental variable support**: For secure settings
- **Dynamic reloading**: Changes without restart

Implementation details:
- Configuration validation
- Sensible defaults
- Secret handling

## Cross-Platform Support

TailPost achieves cross-platform compatibility through:

- Conditional compilation for platform-specific features
- Abstract interfaces for platform-dependent operations
- Unified logging interface
- Platform-specific installers and packages

## Kubernetes Integration

TailPost integrates with Kubernetes via:

- **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**: For declarative configuration
- **Kubernetes Operator**: For deployment and lifecycle management
- **Pod and container log collection**: Native integration with Kubernetes logging

## Data Flow

1. Log Readers collect logs from configured sources
2. Logs pass through the Pipeline for processing
3. The Security layer encrypts and signs if configured
4. Log Senders transmit logs to destinations
5. Telemetry provides visibility into the process

## Error Handling

TailPost implements robust error handling:

- Graceful degradation when components fail
- Automatic recovery from transient errors
- Persistent storage for logs during outages
- Comprehensive error reporting

## Scalability Considerations

TailPost is designed for scalability:

- Efficient resource usage
- Low memory footprint
- Horizontal scaling in Kubernetes
- Rate limiting and throttling mechanisms

## Future Architectural Directions

Planned architectural improvements include:

- Plugin system for extensibility
- Edge processing capabilities
- Enhanced security features
- Additional log sources and destinations
